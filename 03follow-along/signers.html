        <h1>Who Were the Signers</h1>
        <h2>Famous Signers</h2>
        <p>Some of the most famous signers of the Declaration of Independence include:</p>
        
        <dl>
            <dt>Thomas Jefferson</dt>
            <dd>As the principal author of the Declaration, Jefferson's eloquent prose encapsulated the philosophical underpinnings of the American Revolution. His vision for a nation grounded in principles of liberty and democracy was central to the founding of the United States. Jefferson would go on to serve as the third President of the United States and is often considered one of the most intellectually influential Founding Fathers.</dd>
          
            <dt>Benjamin Franklin</dt>
            <dd>Franklin's signature is synonymous with the embodiment of Enlightenment thought in early America. A polymath and diplomatic strategist, Franklin's sagacious contributions as a statesman were pivotal not only in the drafting of the Declaration but also in securing critical French support during the Revolutionary War. His diplomatic finesse and pragmatic wisdom made him one of the most revered figures in American history.</dd>
          
            <dt>John Adams</dt>
            <dd>A towering intellectual and tireless advocate for independence, John Adams was instrumental in the mobilization for revolution. His passionate defense of American rights and liberty, alongside his influential role in the Continental Congress, earned him a prominent place in American history. Adams' leadership and his subsequent service as the second President of the United States further solidified his legacy as a key architect of the Republic.</dd>
          
            <dt>Samuel Adams</dt>
            <dd>A master of political mobilization, Samuel Adams was a fervent revolutionary who helped sow the seeds of dissent against British rule. Known for his leadership in organizing the Boston Tea Party and his role in the Massachusetts colonial resistance, Adams' fiery rhetoric and commitment to independence made him a key figure in the movement toward separation from Britain.</dd>
          
            <dt>John Hancock</dt>
            <dd>As President of the Continental Congress at the time of the signing, John Hancock's signature became symbolic of the act of defiance against British tyranny. His audacity in signing with such prominence underscored his commitment to the cause of independence. Beyond his role in the signing, Hancock was a leading financier and supporter of the Revolution, contributing greatly to the war effort.</dd>
          
            <dt>Richard Henry Lee</dt>
            <dd>A distinguished Virginian statesman, Lee's resolution for independence, introduced in the Continental Congress on June 7, 1776, was the catalyst that set in motion the Declarationâ€™s drafting. A steadfast advocate for liberty, Lee's prescient leadership in the early stages of the Revolutionary War helped galvanize the push for independence.</dd>
          </dl>
          

        <p>These men, among others, represented a broad spectrum of intellectual, political, and military leadership that laid the foundation for the United States. Their collective courage in challenging the authority of the British crown and their commitment to the principles of freedom and self-governance resonate as the cornerstone of American identity.</p>
