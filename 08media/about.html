        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>Hi, My name is Belen,</h2>
        
        <p>I was born and raised in the beautiful country of Ecuador. At the age of 19, I moved to the United States, and since that moment, one of the things I have missed the most—aside from being with my parents—is the food. Growing up, food was more than just sustenance; it was an integral part of my culture and daily life. The vibrant, rich flavors, and the way different ingredients came together to tell a story, shaped my love for cooking. It’s a love that has stayed with me even as I’ve lived miles away from home.</p>
        <p>As the years have passed, I’ve often found myself reaching out to my mom, asking her for recipes passed down through generations. The dishes she makes, recipes taught to her by my grandmother, are nothing short of amazing. They bring back memories of family gatherings, laughter, and the comfort of familiar tastes. In many ways, these recipes are not just about food—they are about preserving the traditions, stories, and love that have been handed down through generations.</p>            
        <p>As a way to honor my family’s legacy and keep these traditions alive, I’d love to share these treasured recipes with you. Food has always been a bridge between the past and the present, and I believe sharing these authentic flavors is a way to connect, celebrate, and keep the spirit of Ecuador alive, no matter where I am.</p>
